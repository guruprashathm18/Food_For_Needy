# FOOD FOR NEEDY 
The proposed application is Web-based, developed on XAMPP using HTML and PHP requires internet connection and will provide a platform for donors and seekers after they successfully register into the system. If a user wishes to donate something, he/she can send a message in application. This message will be shown as notification in donations tab to other users. This message will be stored in back-end in the database. Once a notification is sent, the orphanages who wish to claim the donations can reply to the donor and contact him/her. The user interface of this system will be simple and user-friendly, and the targeted system is android. Simply speaking it is a portal which connects Food needy organization's ( seekers ) and donars.
